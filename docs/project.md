# Slide Machine
The intent of "slide machine" is to provide a simple and smart way to generate slides in various formats and layouts.
A slide is just a two dimensional container of customizable components to meet specific requirements.
The minimum viable product comprises just a background which is the core element of a slide. 
This project examines the power of vector graphics in web browsers and is therefore focused on SVG.
